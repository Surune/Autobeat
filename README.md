Last Update : 2017.11.11

Program which make a notes at proper beat automatically for rhythm game
(This program works only with .wav files)
however you have to name files as the program wants; track1.wav ~ track6.wav
(Sorry for inconvenience, but it was my first program with file I/O...(T_T)

You can test with OOP_Project_helper.py
(it needs you to install pygame and some external libraries)
